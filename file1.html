    <h5>About Me</h5>
      <p>I enrolled in the Intro to Programming class at Epicodus
      because I wanted to challenge myself and explore programming as a possible
      career path.
      I grew up in a suburb outside of Portland called West Linn. I attended
      Lewis & Clark College in Portland, and majored in International Affairs and
      Political Economics. I currently live in the Kerns neighborhood with
      my boyfriend and our two cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was young, I've been drawn to the visual arts. The aspect of programming that interests me the most is the intersection of creative problem solving and design, and I'm exciting to explore its possibilities and limitations over the course of this class.
