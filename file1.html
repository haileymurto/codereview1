    <p> My name is Hailey, and I enrolled in the Intro to Programming class at Epicodus
      because I wanted to challenge myself and explore programming as a possible
      career path.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in a suburb outside of Portland called West Linn. I attended
      Lewis & Clark College in Portland, and majored in International Affairs and
      Political Economics. I currently live in the Kerns neighborhood of Portland with
      my boyfriend and our two cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I was young, I've been drawn to the visual arts. The aspect of programming that interests me the most is the intersection of creative problem solving and design, and I'm exciting to explore its possibilities and limitations over the course of this class.
    </p>
    <p> Here are some things that I like in no particular order: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetarian pho</li>
      <li>Drawing and painting</li>
      <li>Peppermint tea</li>
      <li>Hiking</li>
      <li>The New York Times crossword puzzle (Mondays)</li>
      <li>Getting letters in the mail</li>
      <li>Finding the perfect pair of vintage Levi 501s</li>
      <li>Tall gin & tonics </li>
      </ul>
